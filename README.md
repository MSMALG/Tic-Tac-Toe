This is a straightforward implementation of the "Tic Tac Toe" game using the MiniMax algorithm. Players choose whether they start first or let the computer "bot" begin.

In this game:

Players are represented by the symbol 'O', and the computer by 'X'.
The objective for 'X' (computer) is to maximize the score (1), aiming for a win.
Conversely, the objective for 'O' (player) is to minimize the score (-1), aiming to prevent the computer from winning.
The MiniMax algorithm ensures that the game will either result in a win for the computer or a draw.
This implementation guarantees that the computer will make optimal moves based on the current board state, ensuring a challenging game for the player.
